# Microprocessor Project

## Intro
- This project is about making a Digital Perpetual Calendar that shows time, day, temperature, and humidity.
- In this project, we use stm32 as the core processor, GLCD for display, RTC ds1307, DHT11 sensor for sensing temperature and humidity, and esp for updating time from the internet.
- Our team has 2 members:
  - Me (Thanh Hai). My responsibility is to develop software including change modes, display informations, set day and time, and set alarm.
  - My friend (Minh Khoa). His responsibility is to design a PCB, solder circuit, and develop a driver for display on GLCD, communicate with sensors using i2c.
