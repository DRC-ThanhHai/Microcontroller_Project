# Microcontroller Project

## Intro
- This project is about making a Digital Perpetual Calendar that shows time, day, temperature, and humidity.
- In this project, we use stm32f103C8T6 as the main controller, GLCD for display, RTC ds1307, SHT32 sensor for sensing temperature and humidity, and esp8266 for updating time from the internet.
- Our team has two members:
  - Me (Thanh Hai). My responsibilities are to develop software like change modes, display information, set days and times, and set the alarm.
  - My friend (Minh Khoa). His role is to design PCB and solder components, develop a driver for display on GLCD, and interface with the SHT32 sensor using I2C communication.
